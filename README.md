# Face Detection using OpenCV in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform face detection in real-time using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python. The program captures live video from your webcam and detects faces in each frame.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- Displays the bounding box around detected faces
- Easy to customize for different face detection models

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git
   cd face-detection-opencv
